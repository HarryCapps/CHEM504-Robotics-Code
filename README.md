# CHEM504-Robotics-Code
This GitHub repository contains the code used in a research project for CHEM504 - Robotics and Automation in Chemistry at the University of Liverpool.

## Description

### Project Overview

This project involves automating the Blue Bottle Experiment using a UR5e robotic arm and computer vision. Working in groups, a system to perform the experiment autonomously, detect colour changes, and potentially analyse the reaction kinetics will be designed. Subject to chemical availability, phenosafranine, indigo carmine, and resazurin may also be considered.

### The Blue Bottle Experiment

The Blue Bottle Experiment demonstrates the reversible oxidation and reduction of methylene blue. When shaken, the solution mixes with oxygen, oxidising methylene blue to its blue form. Over time, the dissolved oxygen is consumed by glucose in the reaction, and methylene blue is reduced to its colourless form.

## Prerequisites

The following software is required to run the code and acquire the appropriate data:

- Visual Studio Code (or other code editor) - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Arduino IDE - https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
- Python (Anaconda is recommended. To install, click "Free Download using the URL") - https://www.anaconda.com/

The following pieces of equipment are also required:

- UR5e
- HD Web camera
- Hotplate stirrer
- Sample vial(s)
- 20 mm magnetic stirrer bar(s)
- White background

## Installation


## Usage

Below is a set of instructions for collecting data using the hardware listed before and the code provided.
1. Turn on the UR5e robotic arm.
2. Connect the HD Web camera to your computer.
3. Place your sample vials in the home position(s), each containing a 20 mm magnetic stirrer bar.
4. Position your camera in front of a white background where the robot will hold the sample vials for a given length of time.
5. Run the Robotic Movements Code.
